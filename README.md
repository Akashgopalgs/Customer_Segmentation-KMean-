## Overview
This repository contains a customer segmentation project that uses K-Means clustering to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior. The dataset includes various attributes related to customer spending, demographics, and promotions. The project processes and analyzes the data to identify distinct customer segments, which can be used for targeted marketing and strategic decision-making.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering and creation of new features
   - Outlier detection and removal

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Distribution plots of various features
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualization of clusters

3. **Clustering:**
   - KMeans clustering to segment customers
   - Determination of optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
   - Visualization of clusters and analysis of cluster profiles

4. **Streamlit Web App:**
   - A Streamlit application to predict customer clusters based on user inputs.
   - **Streamli App**: https://mfcupenpeeanbwfguqbvm8.streamlit.app
